            <h1> Hello! My name is Igor Leal! ü¶ù</h1>
            <p>
                üå± Today I'm studying JS, HTML and CSS!
                <br><br>
                ‚ö° fun fact: one day I was studying game development, very early on, and I thought "wow, programming is
                really weird, I hope I don't need to use it in unity"... and here I am, I started studying databases
                with MySQL and now delving into the web hahaha.
                <br><br>
                üëÄ Another curiosity is that I have friends who work with programming and I've been told that I would do
                well, after all, I've always liked things that involve logic and creativity. Well, they were right.
                After I asked for guidance to start studying I really liked it and I'm totally dedicated!

                <p>The purpose of this project was create a tribute page about someone... but I didn't know who I wanted
                    to do so just maked a page about one lovely character of a game that I like hehe</p>
